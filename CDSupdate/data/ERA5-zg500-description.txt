This parameter is the gravitational potential energy of a unit mass, at a particular location, relative to mean sea level. It is also the amount of work that would have to be done, against the force of gravity, to lift a unit mass to that location from mean sea level. The geopotential height can be calculated by dividing the geopotential by the Earth's gravitational acceleration, g (=9.80665 m s-2). The geopotential height plays an important role in synoptic meteorology (analysis of weather patterns). Charts of geopotential height plotted at constant pressure levels (e.g., 300, 500 or 850 hPa) can be used to identify weather systems such as cyclones, anticyclones, troughs and ridges. At the surface of the Earth, this parameter shows the variations in geopotential (height) of the surface, and is often referred to as the orography.
