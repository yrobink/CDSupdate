# CDSupdate

CDSupdate is a Python package that automates the process of retrieving, processing, and managing climate data from the Climate
Data Store (CDS) API. The tool generates daily climate data summaries, performs calculations to create custom variables such as
relative humidity and heat index which serve as risk assessments, and organizes the data into a user-friendly format. 


## Installation

CDSupdate requires the following packages:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `xarray`
- `netCDF4`
- `cftime`
- `cdsapi`
